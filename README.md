# New York Citi Bike Sharing Data Analysis 
Data Bootcamp Week 15-Tableau

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of repository is to analyze data provided from a csv file using Tableau Public. The data represents information about New York City's bikesharing program (Citi Bike). This data will help us make a case for replicating the program in Des Moines, Iowa. 

Using Python and Pandas functions, I converted the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype to get the time in hours, minutes, and seconds (00:00:00). After I converted the "tripduration" column to a datetime dataytpe, I exported the DataFrame as a CSV file to use for the trip analysis in Deliverable 2.
